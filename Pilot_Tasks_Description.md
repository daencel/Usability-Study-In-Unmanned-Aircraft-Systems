# Pilot Task Plan — Detailed Procedures

This document defines each task with the items and stimuli needed and the scripts for any human interaction. Each pilot will perform 4 main tasks (Search, Landing, Distraction, Radio), with embedded stressor variants.

### Equipment checklist

- Drone (DJI Matrice 4T) with all the setup.
- Eye-tracking system setup
- Smartwatch setup
- 1 GoPro and 2 OBSBOT cameras with mounts and cables
- External audio recorder
- Radio device
- Portable speaker for sound playback
- Written scripts
- Consent forms
- PC setup with iMotions installed

### Pre Sudy checklist

What needs to be done before pilots arrive:

- place multiple green markers (required for lading task) at different spots with different levels of difficulty
- hide red markers (for search task) at different levels of difficulty
- prepare and connect the whole sensors setup

## Task 1 — Search Task (Time pressure)

_Objective: Participant searches for a hidden target while under time pressure_

**Duration: ~2 minutes**

Detailed sequence:

1. **Briefing**: Pilot gets told: “You will perform a search in this area to find a hidden target (red marker). You have a maximum of 2 minutes”
2. **During search**: No additional stimuli unless one of the variants is scheduled for this run. If not, pilot performs search normally. If target is found, search for another one.
3. **End**: At 2 minutes, experimenter signals: “Time over.”

Required items:

- Hidden markers (high-visibility red items) placed prior to pilot arrival.
- Stopwatch

Variants:

- optional announced helicopter approach “Helicopter arrived in 30 seconds; clear the area.” - with sound

## Task 2 — Landing (Cognitive challenge)

_Objective: Land the drone in difficult terrain at a predetermined but unknown to pilot spot. This tests precision and decision-making when landing on an unfamiliar small surface._

**Duration: ~2 minutes**

Detailed sequence:

1. **Briefing**: Pilot told: “You will be asked to land at one of the predefined green markers. You should attempt to land as safely and precisely as possible.” (maybe here we can print a small map of the surrouning area beforehand and mark the green markers)
2. **Announcement**: Experimenter says: “Land at marker now.” (Marker is placed in a location with uneven ground or limited flat space.)
3. **Landing:** Pilot conducts landing maneuver.
4. **Take off:** Pilot takes off again and task is completed

**Required items:**

- Multiple landing markers (high-visibility green item) fixed to small visible objects in the field.
- Markers placed in locations selected for increasing difficulty (rocks, slope, small flat area).

Variants:

- Landing with additional person approaching the landing zone
- more than 1 landing can be performed (at different markers)

## Task 3 — Distraction (Cognitive) — People-approach and Interaction

_Objective: Introduce human interaction and verbal distraction while pilot is operating._

**Duration: ~4 minutes**

Detailed sequence:

1. **Setup:** Pilot flying in a routine search/hover.
2. **Appraoch:** At specific time, two actors walk toward the pilot
3. **Distraction:** Distraction takes palce with predetermined sctipts (scrips in Scripts submenu)
4. **Physical distraction:** attempt to take a photo with their phone of the controller/drone (at safe distance)
5. **Conculsion:** After 90–120 s, actor thank the pilot and leave the area calmly.

Required items:

- actor with script
- script sheet

Variants :

- Pilot may ask actor to step back or shut up, actor can be a bit puhsy and ignore these requests to distress the pilot

## Task 4 — Radio Task (Rapid change of situation via radio + continued distraction)

Objective: Introduce a radio message that requires immediate prioritization and a manual action that removes one hand from the controller (e.g., pressing a radio button, reading a message on a separate device, or operating a tablet).

**Duration: ~2 minutes**

Detailed sequence:

1. Pilot is about to finish previous task.
2. At a scripted moment, the radio operator transmits a message over the pilot’s radio device with a clear priority: urgent location update, helicopter coordination, or critical patient update. (scrips in "Radio Scripts" submenu)

Required items:

- Functional radio device or speaker with pre-recorded messages.
- Tablet or secondary device to be used in Script C (if used); ensure it is mounted so pilot can safely operate it.

Distraction script (confederates) — print and laminate:
• See Task 3 verbatim lines above. Add escalation lines only if needed and permitted by safety: “We thought you were the rescue team; could you take a look?” and actor must always wait for pilot response.

### Debrief procedure

Immediately after each pilot session:

- Finish all the recordings and the study on iMotions
- Pilot takes off all the gear and sensors
- All three video streams get transferred to a USB stick and viewed on different device

### Randomization / Order permutations for 5 pilots

We need five sequences (orders) to permute tasks across the five volunteers to reduce order effects.

- Order 1 (PILOT 1): A → B → C → D
- Order 2 (PILOT 2): B → D → A → C
- Order 3 (PILOT 3): C → A → D → B
- Order 4 (PILOT 4): D → C → B → A
- Order 5 (PILOT 5): A → D → B → C

## Radio scripts for Task 4

#### Script A — Helicopter approach (Audio)

“Helicopter ETA two minutes. Landing zone requires clearing. Pilot X, please confirm you can secure the LZ and advise whether you need immediate support.” (pause for pilot reply)

#### Script B — Patient critical update (Audio)

“Pilot X, urgent update. Subject at grid 12345 is in critical condition — suspect internal bleeding. Immediate extraction recommended. Please confirm if you can reach them or need assistance.” (pause for pilot reply)

#### Script C — Equipment operation request (Audio + simulated physical task)

“Pilot X, please switch to channel Y and confirm receipt. Then take a quick photo of the landing site.” (This requires pilot to take one hand from the controller)

#### Script D — Equipment operation request (Audio)

“Pilot X, big storm coming from Nort-West. Return to point of start and land immiedatly. Do you copy?” (pause for pilot reply)

## Distraction scripts for Task

For the different scripts I had the idea to integrate different characters played by one actor. The characters might be a confused bystander, an assistant who insists on answers, photographer etc. For each character, if pilot answers to the written scripts, keep pushing that topic and lightly escalate.

### Character 1: Curious Observer

Actor Role: Civilian curious about the drone.

Script lines:

- “Wow, is that the drone you’re controlling? Can I see it closer?”
- “How do you make it stay so steady in the air? That looks tricky!”
- Optional escalation: “Wait, are you allowed to fly that here? Isn’t this restricted?”

### Character 2: Persistent Questioning

Actor Role: Reporter who insists on answers.

Script lines:

- “Hey, I need a quick comment for our report — what’s the battery life on that?”
- “Can you demonstrate a maneuver? Just a quick one?”
- If pilot asks to step back: “Oh come on, it won’t take long! Just one picture?”

### Character 3: Mistaken Rescue Request

Actor Role: Confused bystanders requesting help.

Script lines:

- “Excuse me! Are you part of the rescue team? We need help over there!”
- “Can you check on someone in that field? It’s urgent!”
- Optional escalation: “We thought you were the rescue team; could you take a look?”

### Character 4: Photo Interruption

Actor Role: Photographer / influencer trying to document the operation.

Script lines:

- “Excuse me, can I take a quick photo? It’s for a feature article!”
- If pilot refuses: “It’ll just take one second, please!”
- Optional escalation: “I really need this shot. come on, it won’t interfere with what you’re doing!”
